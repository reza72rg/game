# Number Guessing Game

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This is a simple number guessing game written in Python. The program prompts the player to enter their name and then generates a random number between 0 and 100. The player's objective is to guess the generated number by following the instructions provided by the program.

## Game Modes

### 1. Guess the Number

In this mode, the program generates a random number between 0 and 100. The player needs to input their guesses and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. The player continues guessing until they correctly guess the number.

### 2. Help the System Guess the Number

In this mode, the player thinks of a number between 0 and 100. The program then tries to guess the number by asking the player for instructions. The player provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, helping the program refine its guess. The game continues until the program correctly guesses the number.
